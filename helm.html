								<h2>How to get the masks?</h2>
								<p>There are nine masks in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The first four can be purchased from Kilton the Monster Parts Merchant. The last five require specific amiibo.</p>
															
								<h2>Uses</h2>
								<p>Wearing each mask will provide protection from those particular monsters as long as the mask is worn (but only temporary for the Lynel).
									Some helmets also have special effects.
